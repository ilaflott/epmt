Dash:
    Dash operates with Layouts, Callbacks and some very basic startup commands.

    Layouts:
            Layouts generate HTML to be served
            Layouts use Dash Components for example:
                dash_table.DataTable 
                html.Div

    Callbacks:
            Callbacks provide interactivity to the webpage.
            Callbacks are methods that take input and provide output to the Layout
            Callbacks can have multiple inputs and states as input and replace contents
                within the Layout using ID tags

            Callback Example:
                # Callback for excel download
                @app.callback(
                    Output('download-link-metasearch-1', 'href'),
                    [Input('my-date-picker-range-metasearch', 'start_date'),
                    Input('my-date-picker-range-metasearch', 'end_date')])   
                def update_link(start_date, end_date):
                    # Do excel download things
            
            This example passes the inputs start_date and end_date values from my-date-picker-range-metasearch, 
            to the update_link method under the variable names start_date and end_date.
            my-date-picker-range-metasearch is the id of a component in the layout.


Current Status:
    Working:
        Fuzzy Searching/Partial matches
            start_time=12
            start_time=01:33 PM
            exit status=1
            tags=c96l49
            
        Exact search matches on
            start_time==01:33 PM UTC
            processing complete==Yes
            exit status==1
        
        Greater/Less than:
            duration (HH:MM:SS)>15:00:00
            duration (HH:MM:SS)>15:00

    Broken:
        Any search using raw switch converted data
        duration (HH:MM:SS)=16
        usertime (%cpu_time)=1


Implementation:
    This Multi Layout structure Uses App.py as the Main module.
        index.py configures app.py with the layout based on the url that is requested
        layouts.py contains the separate layouts that will be used as pages
        callbacks.py is all the callbacks that will be used throughout the dash
    Dash Components:
        Currently Using DataTables means dataframes will be in favor rather than dictionaries.
        Datatables have the ability to handle selections for callbacks to make interactive pages.

    DATATABLES:
    Column Sorting CSS:
        By default datatables column sorting works by a very small triangle group
        in the upper left.  This hotspot is only around those triangles.  I've done
        some CSS work in 'assets/KQrXdb.css' to force the triangle hotspot 
        to take up the entire header of each column.
        This causes the text to be behind the hotspot.  All this work however,
        depends on the datatable to have this specific styling to keep the text
        within bounds & sized appropriately :
        '''
        fixed_rows={ 'headers': True, 'data': 0 },
                #fixed_columns={ 'headers': True, 'data': 1 },#, Css is not setup for this
                style_table={
                'padding': '5px',
                'font-size':'14px'
                },
                style_header={
                  'font-weight':'bold',
                  'padding': '5px',
                  'whiteSpace':'normal',
                },
                style_cell={
                  'font-family':'sans-serif',
                  'overflow': 'hidden',
                  'minWidth': '100px',
                },
        '''

    Dash Bootstrap Layouts I used are here:
    https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/l/components/layout

Plans:

Phase 1: 
The goal will be for us to iterate quickly, run locally, see and comment. 
    basic displays/routes down 
    Display that displays a list
    allows a set of things to be selected
    prints those lists upon selection would be fine 
        (By printing I mean logger.debug() to stdout)
    Abbreviated vs raw display toggle
        Abbreviated is basically a “human readable view” of a small subset of the raw data
            as well as put into human readable units. 
    For abbreviated metrics let’s try this for now: duration in h:m:s, 
        % in user, % in system, % sleeping (wall-user-sys), 
        % iowait (see iowait in Data) Bytes in, bytes out(try using gb,tb,mb,kB) 
        to keep fields short, exit status
        For extra credit see if you can render the jobs with non-zero exit status in red.




Phase 2:
    wire up interactivity and workflows.
        That may take some time and require some CSS templating like bootstrap
    Each display from the beginning should not assume anything about its own viewport. 
    i.e. it might eventually be in a separate window, frame or region of the screen.
            :: This is mostly handled by Dash layouts.  Each dash component can be moved
    It should also be display aware, lay itself out on phone, a tablet and a laptop
    Bootstrap helps with that

UnitTesting:
    For unit testing, the GUI just mocks calls to the API
    So in that case, be very sure you are not tying the two together... 
    The API is just where you will be getting the information from, but it’s conceivable isn’t he future that you get the info another way, 
    like a REST call. So you need to keep the ‘data access’ separate from the ‘display logic’.

    Links:
        https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/297
        https://dash.plot.ly/testing


 
And be ready for the real ones. You can use a local DB if you want, but again, I’m going to test it in CI without EPMT. ;-)
I think the API may be that module - since it returns data frames and lists and stuff. So you just need stub functions that return static data as a placeholder for now.

This display engine, like the last one you wrote, will be drivable by URL routes, which I will shortly outline in the documentation

This means every display should be able to be duplicated with a URL

unprocessed vs processed jobs.

So that’s x.y.z.a/jobs&unprocessed=True or processed=False or some representation of the arguments
just dumping raw info.

WHat we are showing doesn’t quite matter as much early on as how we are doing it. That’s important to get right
You are allowed to assume contents of the returned data frame up to the actual metrics. Those you get from the headers.
I.e. you can assume a job Id but you can’t necessarily assume papiex metrics...
Basically, what’s in the job model is ok to assume
Everything after is data driven


We will be building out the routes slowly and each functionality over time, 
making sure each display is right before we move on.

Well for the first one, you’ll only need to mock one call - get unprocessed jobs
And you are only going to fetch the last N of them, where N is a default

(saved in a cookie)

interacting displays, i.e. you have selected multiple jobs in the unprocessed job list
For example:
update a display 
    every time someone clicks on another job 
        as they are adding them to a set)

real logging (just hardcode verbosity and location)

And comments comments comments... without comments we will be lost
I put one in the card that does about what we need, that should be good. Read through that one - and see if you need more. I think you need less than that link, because we’re not graphing anything at this point, just displaying lists that can be selected, sorted etc.
For the purposes of DRY code, you can assume any time we want to print/render a table, we will want to be able to 1) Select one or more rows 2) Sort on any column.
You can figure out what kind of interactivity we have, i.e, do we need to click a row and then click a button (route) or is the GUI reactive, where a single click does it. (I don’t think Dash/Flask will let us do the latter, which is ok, but we need to know)



works without calling the API
If you end up making assumptions about what’s in the database, you need to be aware of that.


testing it on a vanilla phusion/baseimage:0.10.2 docker image with only a python 3.7 installed.

(Similar to recipe from the Dockerfiles)

not testing with EPMT
script that will install requirements
run the GUI via docker
export the port to local host

That way we can unit test the GUI super easily.
research how we test python/dash guis automatically.

I’ve decided I could get a display working like this in 8-10 hours with no experience but lots of online reading.
Even sorting isn’t important. Forget about the details, just get the list done first
