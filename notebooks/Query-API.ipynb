    "# EPMT Query API\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook will illustrate the usage of the EPMT Query API. \n",
    "\n",
    "`EPMT` stores job/process/thread data and metadata in a database, be that a local file\n",
    "or a database server. Access to the database is provided by the EPMT Query API, which\n",
    "provides functions specifically tailored to the needs of a performance analyst. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data from the query functions can be returned in a variety of formats. The most\n",
    "useful and recommended option is the `pandas` format, which returns a Pandas\n",
    "dataframe. Other formats include, `terse`, which provides a concise listing, and\n",
    "`dict`, which returns collections a lists of python dictionaries. We also have a\n",
    "powerful `orm` return format, that provides an ORM object, which provides for\n",
    "lazy execution of SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this notebook will walk you through the API calls, starting with\n",
    "the highest-level job queries, followed by more granular operation-level queries,\n",
    "followed by low-level process and thread queries. As you analyze your data, you will\n",
    "likely find this hierarchial approach useful in analyzing performance issues.\n",

    "\n",
    "The API functions can be broadly put into a few categories based on the hierarchy of data they operate on: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Job-level queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions operate on individual jobs or a collections of jobs. A job can be thought of\n",
    "as what we submit to a batch system to execute. It's a collection of processes. Job-level\n",
    "queries include `get_jobs`, `get_job_tags`, `are_jobs_comparable`, and `comparable_job_partitions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operation-level queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions operate on the level of operations. An operation can be considered as a collection of processes that share some common tags. A tag is a collection of key/value pairs (a dictionary, if you will), and we associate these tags with processes at the time of execution using the environment variable `PAPIEX_TAGS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, a process tagged with `'op:hsmget;op_instance:1;op_sequence:2'`\n",
    "and another process tagged, with `'op:hsmget;op_instance:2;op_sequence:5'`. Then in terms of the \n",
    "most granular operation, the two processes belong to different operations. However, if we consider the\n",
    "higher-level operation `'op:hsmget'`, then the two processes belong to the same high-level operation.\n",
    "So an operation is intimately tied to the tag defining it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of operation queries include, `get_ops`, and `get_op_metrics`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process-level queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions operate on individual processes. A process constitutes of one or more threads. If a process\n",
    "consists of a single thread, then the thread data is the process data. For multithreaded runs, the process\n",
    "data is obtained by summation over the inidividual threads. Process-level tend to be more time-consuming, as the number of processes are many orders of magnitude more than the number of jobs. Example of process-level queries include `get_procs`, `job_proc_tags`, `conv_procs`, `rank_proc_tags_keys` and `timeline`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thread-level queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "At present we have only a single API call for this category: `get_thread_metrics`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference model calls**\n",
    "\n",
    "A reference model is a collection of a limited number of jobs or operations. It is used to\n",
    "serve as reference when determining whether other jobs or operations are inliers or outliers.\n",
    "Example of such calls include `create_refmodel`, `delete_refmodels` and `get_refmodels`. We\n",
    "won't be discussing reference model API calls in this notebook. They will be discussed in detail\n",
    "in the Outliers notebook.\n"
